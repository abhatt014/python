# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
# Write a Python program that does the following: 
#   1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
#   2. Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers: 
#       Addition
#       Subtraction
#       Multiplication
#       Division
#   3. Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
# Expected Output: (Assuming user enters 5 and 10) 
#   Enter the first number: 5
#   Enter the second number: 10
#   Addition: 15
#   Subtraction: -5
#   Multiplication: 50
#   Division: 0.5

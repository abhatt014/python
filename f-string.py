# name = "Alice john"
# age = 30
# city = "Wonderland"

# # string variable functions
# print(name.upper()) # "ALICE"
# print(name.lower()) # "alice"
# print(name.capitalize()) # "Alice John"



# # Using an f-string
# greeting = f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and I live in {city}." 
# print(greeting)
# # Output: My name is Alice, I am 30 years old, and I live in Wonderland.

# # You can include more complex expressions:
# print(f"Next year, {name} will be {age + 1} years old.") 
# # Output: Next year, Alice will be 31 years old.

# # You can even call functions within f-strings:
# print(f"My name in uppercase is {name.upper()}.") 
# # Output: My name in uppercase is ALICE.
